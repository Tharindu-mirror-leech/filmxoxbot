#### ‚¨áÔ∏è Notes

* ***All commands can also be called using dot(.) instead of slash(/). For e.x:*** `.mirror <url>` or `.m <url>`

* ***All commands except** `list` **can have the bot's username appended to them. See*** `COMMANDS_USE_BOT_NAME` ***under [constants description](#Constants-description).*** *This is useful if you have multiple instances of this bot in the same group.*

* *While creating a Telegram bot in the [pre-installation](#Pre-installation]) section below, you might want to add the above commands to your new bot by using `/setcommand` in BotFather, make sure all the commands are in lower case. This will cause a list of available bot commands to pop up in chats when you type `/`, and you can long press one of them to select it instead of typing out the entire command.*

-----
## Bittorrent Seed

- Add `d:ratio:time` perfix along with leech or mirror cmd.
- Using `d` perfix alone will lead to use global options for aria2c or qbittorrent.

### Qbittorrent
- Global options: `MaxRatio` and `GlobalMaxSeedingMinutes` in qbittorrent.conf, `-1` means no limit, but you can cancel manually.
  - **NOTE**: Don't change `MaxRatioAction`.

### Aria2c
- Global options: `--seed-ratio` (0 means no limit) and `--seed-time` (0 means no seed) in aria.sh.

------
### ‚¨áÔ∏è Using Service Accounts for uploading to avoid user rate limit

>For Service Account to work, you must set `USE_SERVICE_ACCOUNTS` = "True" in config file or environment variables.
>**NOTE**: Using Service Accounts is only recommended while uploading to a Team Drive.

### *1. Generate Service Accounts.* [What is Service Account?](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts)
*Let us create only the Service Accounts that we need.*

**Warning**: *Abuse of this feature is not the aim of this project and we do **NOT** recommend that you make a lot of projects, just one project and 100 SAs allow you plenty of use, its also possible that over abuse might get your projects banned by Google.*

>**NOTE**: If you have created SAs in past from this script, you can also just re download the keys by running:
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --download-keys $PROJECTID
```
>**NOTE:** 1 Service Account can upload/copy around 750 GB a day, 1 project can make 100 Service Accounts so you can upload 75 TB a day or clone 2 TB from each file creator (uploader email).

#### ‚¨áÔ∏è Two methods to create service accounts
**Choose one of these methods*

##### *1. Create Service Accounts in existed Project (Recommended Method)*
- *List your projects ids*
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --list-projects
```
- *Enable services automatically by this command*
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --enable-services $PROJECTID
```
- *Create Sevice Accounts to current project*
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --create-sas $PROJECTID
```
- *Download Sevice Accounts as accounts folder*
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --download-keys $PROJECTID
```

##### *2. Create Service Accounts in New Project*
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --quick-setup 1 --new-only
```
*A folder named accounts will be created which will contain keys for the Service Accounts.*

### *2. Add Service Accounts*

#### *Two methods to add service accounts*
*Choose one of these methods*

##### *1. Add Them To Google Group then to Team Drive (Recommended)*
- *Mount accounts folder*
```
cd accounts
```
- *Grab emails form all accounts to emails.txt file that would be created in accounts folder*
- `For Windows using PowerShell`
```
$emails = Get-ChildItem .\**.json |Get-Content -Raw |ConvertFrom-Json |Select -ExpandProperty client_email >>emails.txt
```
- `For Linux`
```
grep -oPh '"client_email": "\K[^"]+' *.json > emails.txt
```
- *Unmount acounts folder*
```
cd ..
```
*Then add emails from emails.txt to Google Group, after that add this Google Group to your Shared Drive and promote it to manager and delete email.txt file from accounts folder*

##### *2. Add Them To Team Drive Directly*
- *Run:*
```
python3 add_to_team_drive.py -d SharedTeamDriveSrcID
```

- *You can skip adding the privates files like token.pickle or accounts folder before deploying, also no need to add variables direct links except **config.env**, simply fill `UPSTREAM_REPO` private one in case you want to grab all files including private files.*
- *If you added private files while deploying and you have added private `UPSTREAM_REPO` and your private files in this private repository, so your private files will be overwritten from this repository. Also if you are using URL variables like `TOKEN_PICKLE_URL` then all files from those variables will override the private files that added before deploying or from private `UPSTREAM_REPO`.*
- *If you filled `UPSTREAM_REPO` with the official repository link, then be carefull incase any change in requirements.txt your bot will not start after restart. In this case you need to deploy again with updated code to install the new requirements or simply by changing the `UPSTREAM_REPO` to you fork link with that old updates.*
- *In case you you filled `UPSTREAM_REPO` with your fork link be carefull also if you fetched the commits from the official repository.*
- *The changes in your `UPSTREAM_REPO` will take affect only after restart.*
- *`UPSTREAM_BRANCH` don't ever fill heroku here.*

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Bittorrent Seed
- *Add `d:ratio:time` perfix along with leech or mirror cmd.*
- *Using `d` perfix alone will lead to use global options for aria2c or qbittorrent.*

### ‚¨áÔ∏è Qbittorrent
- *Global options: `MaxRatio` and `GlobalMaxSeedingMinutes` in qbittorrent.conf, `-1` means no limit, but you can cancel manually.*
  - ***NOTE***: *Don't change `MaxRatioAction`*.

### ‚¨áÔ∏è Aria2c
- *Global options: `--seed-ratio` (0 means no limit) and `--seed-time` (0 means no seed) in aria.sh.*

- *Choose Desktop and Create.*
- *Use the download button to download your credentials.*
- *Move that file to the root of mirrorbot, and rename it to **credentials.json***
- *Visit [Google API page](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library)*
- *Search for Drive and enable it if it is disabled*
- *Finally, run the script to generate **token.pickle** file for Google Drive:*

## ‚¨áÔ∏è **Using Service Accounts for uploading to avoid user rate limit**
*For Service Account to work, you must set **USE_SERVICE_ACCOUNTS=**"True" in config file or environment variables, 
Many thanks to [AutoRClone](https://github.com/xyou365/AutoRclone) for the scripts.
**NOTE**: Using Service Accounts is only recommended while uploading to a Team Drive.*

## ‚¨áÔ∏è **Generate Service Accounts.** [What is Service Account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts)
<details>
    <summary><b>Click Here For More Details</b></summary>

Let us create only the Service Accounts that we need. 
**Warning**: abuse of this feature is not the aim of this project and we do **NOT** recommend that you make a lot of projects, just one project and 100 SAs allow you plenty of use, its also possible that over abuse might get your projects banned by Google. 

**NOTE:** 1 Service Account can copy around 750gb a day, 1 project can make 100 Service Accounts so that's 75tb a day, for most users this should easily suffice.
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --quick-setup 1 --new-only
```
A folder named accounts will be created which will contain keys for the Service Accounts.

Or you can create Service Accounts to current project, no need to create new one

- List your projects ids
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --list-projects
```
- Enable services automatically by this command
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --enable-services $PROJECTID
```
- Create Sevice Accounts to current project
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --create-sas $PROJECTID
```
- Download Sevice Accounts as accounts folder
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --download-keys $PROJECTID
```
If you want to add Service Accounts to Google Group, follow these steps

- Mount accounts folder
```
cd accounts
```
- Grab emails form all accounts to emails.txt file that would be created in accounts folder
```
grep -oPh '"client_email": "\K[^"]+' *.json > emails.txt
```
- Unmount acounts folder
```
cd -
```
Then add emails from emails.txt to Google Group, after that add Google Group to your Shared Drive and promote it to manager.

**NOTE**: If you have created SAs in past from this script, you can also just re download the keys by running:
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --download-keys project_id
```

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Add all the Service Accounts to the Team Drive
- Run:
```
python3 add_to_team_drive.py -d SharedTeamDriveSrcID
```

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Youtube-dl authentication using [.netrc](https://github.com/Spark-X-Cloud/SparkXcloud-Gdrive-MirrorBot/blob/master/.netrc) file
*For using your premium accounts in Youtube-dl or for protected Index Links, edit the netrc file according to following format:*
```
machine host login username password my_youtube_password
```
*For Index Link with only password without username, even http auth will not work, so this is the solution.*
```
machine example.workers.dev password index_password
```
-----
*Where host is the name of extractor (eg. Youtube, Twitch). Multiple accounts of different hosts can be added each separated by a new line.*
